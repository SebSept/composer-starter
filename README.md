# Composer Project Bedrock

Ready to use repository for any composer project.

Usage `composer create-project sebsept/composer-starter:dev-main my-new-project`

Then you have a folder with dev tools and composer.json with scripts + a git pre-commit hook installed.

All is written inside the [composer.json](composer.json).
